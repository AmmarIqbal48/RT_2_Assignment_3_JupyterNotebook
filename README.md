# Jupyter Notebook User Interface for ROS RVIZ GAZEBO PYTHON


## Abstract
Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application which is used to create and share documents that contain real-time code, equation, data visualizations, text, and so on. This Jupyetr Nootebook is designed to create the User Interface of my code. Also, this notebook is developed as an user interface for the the project Software Architecture for Mobile Robot Control. For this, Jupyter Notebook tool is used.

## Objective
This user interface should be able to control the project ROS RVIZ GAZEBO PYTHON. Also, user can operates and change the robot's behvaiour depending on their choice. Robot's Behvaiour can be autonomous drive, manual drive using teleop, and manual drive using teleop and avoiding the collisions.


## Installation
To create Jupyter Interface, Jupyter Notebook tool is required on your system. To install Jupyter follow the steps given below:

pip3 install jupyter bqplot pyyaml ipywidgets
